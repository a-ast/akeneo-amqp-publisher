# TODO

1. What about repeatable commands? Counter?
1. Implement response validation in handlers.
1. Renew docs
1. Add AddValue atomic command? How to achieve it with consistent behaviour? 

1. Even better - only onRepeatCallback - all oters just fail
    Think of : permission issues, others
    think of mass import with permission issues: should we stop import 
    - why not if we don't send Acknowledge - it will be still persisted, right?

1. Check repsonse of Delete and MediaHandler
