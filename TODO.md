# TODO

1. SUPER URGENT: What about repeatable commands? Counter?
1. !!! Renew docs
1. Add AddValue atomic command? How to achieve it with consistent behaviour? 

1. Even better - only onRepeatCallback - all oters just fail
    Think of : permission issues, others
    think of mass import with permission issues: should we stop import 
    - why not if we don't send Acknowledge - it will be still persisted, right?
