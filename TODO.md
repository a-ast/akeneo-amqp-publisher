# TODO

1. !!! Renew docs
1. Add AddValue atomic command? How to achieve it with consistent behaviour? 

1. Even better - only onRepeatCallback - all others just fail
    Think of : permission issues, others
    think of mass import with permission issues: should we stop import 
    - why not? if we don't send Acknowledge - it will be processed later from queue?
